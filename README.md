This repo contains notes and programming assignments for the Udemy's "[Mastering RTOS: Hands on FreeRTOS and STM32Fx with Debugging (RTOS)](https://www.udemy.com/course/mastering-rtos-hands-on-with-freertos-arduino-and-stm32fx/)" course by FastBit Embedded Brain Academy.

## Descriptions

In this course, we will demystify the complete Architecture (ARM Cortex-M) related code of FreeRTOS and STM32 MCUs.

The course covers:
1. Understanding various RTOS concepts with FreeRTOS Programming and Debugging.
2. Important scheduling policies of FreeRTOS Scheduler.
3. Implementing mutual exclusion between Tasks using Mutex services and semaphores.
4. Understanding Architecture specific codes like SVC_handler, PendSV_handler, SysTick Handler line by line.
5. Understanding complete ARM Cortex M and FreeRTOS Priority model and its configuration related informations.
6. FreeRTOS Task Creation , Deletion, Scheduling.
7. FreeRTOS Stack and Heap Management.
8. FreeRTOS Queue management like creation, sending, receiving, and blocking.
9. Understanding Context Switching with in detail code explanation.
10. Kernel Tick timer, frequency and its configuration details.
11. FreeRTOS Debugging using SEGGER SystemView Software.
12. Debugging with SEGGER software toolkit by taking snapshot and continuous mode recording.
